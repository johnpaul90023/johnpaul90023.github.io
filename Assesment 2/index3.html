            <h1> Starter Web Developer </h1>
            <p> I provide services in web development as I have professions in html, css, and javascript. Though I am not a professional due to the fact that I have started learning about html, css, and javascript. I also have some knowledge in other languages such as c++, c#, and python. Languages that I have currently learned yet are starters for now as I haven't gone through advance coding. I know how to generate abstract and beautiful designs though have not yet mastered it. I am currently still learning more about html, css, and javascript and broadening my knowledge to reach the advanced coding.</p>

            <h1> Graphic Designer </h1>
            <p> I provide services in graphic design as I have professions in canva, figma and photoshop. I can create logos, web design templates, app templates, and posters with the use of canva, figma and photoshop. Photoshop would be the best app for me if I were to create a graphical design for you or with the use of canva. I may generate the design depending on what are your suggestions and type of design you are needing.</p>
